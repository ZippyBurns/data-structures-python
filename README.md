# Data Structures in Python — 21-Day Interview Plan

A focused, ADHD-friendly path to rebuild fundamentals and get interview-ready.
Each day has a topic, a small implementation, and a few practice problems.

## How to use
- Each day: 15m notes → 45m build → 30m practice.
- Push daily progress: `weekN/<topic>.py` and short notes in README/docstring.
- Run tests: `pytest -q`

## Structure
```
week1/  # arrays, strings, stacks, queues, linked lists
week2/  # hashing, heaps, trees, trie
week3/  # graphs, topo sort, dsu, patterns, backtracking
common/ # helpers used across exercises
tests/  # pytest unit tests
```
